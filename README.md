##Warning
Pijaret is just a small cipher and not for serious prurpose. <br>
Please see my Schoolwork as a <b> Toycrypter. </b> <br>
<b>The encryption is extremely weak. </b><br>
Read about ROT encryption: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13

##Target
The main purpose is to create a small encryption tool to make services like Whatsapp or Telegram <b> a bit </b> more secure.
The system is easy to understand: You share a numeric key with your partner in real life and en/de-crypt some important messages with it. (In case you donâ€™t go outside you can just tormail your chat partner or stuff)
