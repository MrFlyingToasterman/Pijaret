# Pijaret
Pijaret is just another rotation encryption tool. (For Android)

#It’s Free (as in Freedom)
Feel free to fork, copy or what ever you want.

#Target
The main purpose is to create a small encryptiontool to make services like Whatsapp or Telegram a bit more secure.
The system is easy to understand: You share a numeric key with your partner in reallife and en/de-crypt some important messages with it. (In case you don’t go outside you can just Tormail your Chatpartner or stuff)
