#Target
The main purpose is to create a small encryption tool to make services like Whatsapp or Telegram a bit more secure.
The system is easy to understand: You share a numeric key with your partner in real life and en/de-crypt some important messages with it. (In case you don’t go outside you can just tormail your chat partner or stuff)
